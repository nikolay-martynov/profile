Defining and implementing technology strategy in a subdivision working in the field of integration solutions for operations support systems primarily utilized by communication service providers. The goal is to make sure that business and management expectations are met by:

- Maintaining and improving teams motivation and productivity using Kaizen and WORST. Examples are use of agile development methodologies like SAFe and highly visible Kanban radiators, self-managed cross-functional teams, collective code, failure and success ownership, automatization of development processes.
- Developing or helping to develop solution and system architecture following feasibility and cost analysis in pre-sale support. This also includes design of particular application or subsystem both alone and just helping respective application architect. Results are system decomposition, more precise workload estimation, interfaces definition, selection of technologies to be applied, high level description of subsystems and algorithms to be coded, list of particular engineering tasks to be finished.
- Helping teams to resolve technological issues. Examples include suggestion of not so well-known language and tool features, alternate implementations, algorithms and tools. Sometimes an obstacle is removed by understanding and accepting a trade-off, a change in this or that characteristic of the system or part of the system.
- Developing technologically complex subsystems starting with interface definition (Javadoc); sometimes utilizing test-driven development (TDD); coding in technologies like Java, Groovy, C++, Spring, Camel, Web services, XSLT; unit testing including mocking; developing automated functional and load tests in Shell, Perl, Groovy. Target platforms are mostly Unix flavors like HP-UX and Linux.
- Troubleshooting and resolving escalated support cases both by helping support teams analyze available information and sometimes by doing remote live production system debug.
